Intermediate layers will have learned to detect lower-level information about the images (e.g., one neuron could detect the existence of a muzzle, another could detect more dog-like ears). My goal was to see if I could determine if the network had seen a novel image (e.g., a picture of a person) from examining the activations of the intermediate layers, since presumably these images would result in unusual combinations of activations.'
