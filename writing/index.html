<p>(Too many LitRPG novels treat the main character as the first intelligent person to ever exist somewhere, and it's baffling how dumb they think the "average person" is.)

<p>I open my eyes at the sound of a busy morning and find myself in a doorway, facing the interior of a restaurant housed in what looks like a large cabin.
<em>Wait, what?</em></p>
<p>"Sir, could you please move out of the way? You're blocking our patrons from the store." A tall, bald man, dressed in a long white shirt and dull brown pants, stares down at me with a look of resigned patience.</p>
<p>"I don't understand," I say, allowing myself to be led away from the entrance. "I don't -- How did I get here? ... Where is 'here'?"
I look around as I speak, taking in a building that reminds me of a tourist trap in a mountain town -- treated logs forming the outline, and some sort of sealant stuck between them to prevent any airflow through the gaps.
All the furniture, including a counter, shelves, tables, and chairs appear to be made of the same wood, and illumination comes only from the overcast sky through the the open-air windows, though I see some hanging lanterns at strategic intervals.</p>
<p>"Ah." The man's eyes seem to brighten. "A new Traveler, I wonder?"</p>
<p>"... I'm sorry? I don't understand. Look, I must have been ... sleepwalking." <em>Unlikely, but nothing sounds</em> more <em>plausible.</em> "Do you have a phone I can use to call an Uber or something? I'll be out of your h-- hands in no time." <em>Not a great save.</em></p>
<p>Luckily, the man's smile widens in response.
"Yes, a Traveler indeed! Come, come! You must be famished. Let's get you something to eat while I explain."
He gestures emphatically toward a table and tells me to wait for some food while he goes and grabs a few notes.
When I ask, he just calls them notes on travelers and hurries off.</p>
<p>This has to be some prank.
Nothing stands out about the night before, and there's no reason I can think of for waking up in what looks like the doorway of an Amish diner.
I sit and take stock.
I'm definitely not dreaming.
I feel fine: no headache, no bumps; nothing feels scraped, broken, or bruised, but I am a bit itchy.
I realize I'm dressed similarly to everyone else: thick, dull-colored pants and a long-sleeved, billowing, off-white shirt tied at my waist with a bit of twine.
From the itching, I assume wool, though it might just be due to hygenie of the mystery clothing source.
My pockets are empty, and I don't see a phone anywhere.</p>
<p>At the counter, a woman is trading large coins for cheese, fresh bread, and hot meat.
Everyone walking into the diner greets each person they pass by name, usually accompanied by a nod or a slap on the back.
I get a few curious stares, but my expression must turn them away, though it doesn't prevent smiles and a few polite waves.
Everyone seems too friendly.
I can't decide whether my working theory should be a cult abduction or the weirdest melatonin-induced cross-country sleepwalking session I've ever heard of.
I'm not-so-surreptiously checking myself for needle marks when my host returns with a plate of food in each hand, some looseleaf paper dangling from his grip on the underside of one of the plates.</p>
<p>"There! I'm told you know of 'sandwiches' in your territory?"
He doesn't wait for an answer as he begins to cut his bread into slices and gestures for me to do the same.</p>
<p>I look at my plate and see a sourdough loaf, white cheese, and sausage.
I follow his lead, not seeing any reason to distrust the food.
<em>If this is a cult, they've clearly already drugged me, so I can't do much worse.</em>
I give him an expectant look, which he studiously ignores as he takes a large bite.</p>
<p>I finish first.</p>
<h2 id="wp-you-are-on-board-a-federation-starship-the-universal-translators-have-just-gone-down-during-a-life-or-death-situation-most-of-the-crew-cant-communicate-with-each-other-without-them">[WP] You are on board a federation starship. The universal translators have just gone down during a life-or-death situation. Most of the crew can't communicate with each other without them.</h2>
<p>"God fucking dammit." Captain Tarpals swore, but his inflection never wavered from calm and professional. "The only silver lining is that I can finally call you a worthless slimeball pilot as long as I smile while doing it. Isn't that right, you greasy hunk of snot?"</p>
<p>"OOOgz ba'sjks," officer Jelqsh burbled happily. Well, Tarpals assumed it was happily. A gaping hole for a mouth and blinking eye stalks didn't tell him a whole lot.</p>
<p>"Alright, everybody! Listen up!" Heads perked up from behind various terminals. At least yelling still worked. Tarpals gestured for everyone to come closer. The races with arms started forward. Tarpals grabbed the nearest non-humanoid, a pulsing, fuzzy ball, and pulled it toward the group. That seemed to get the message across to the rest of them, and they all gathered at the back of the bridge.</p>
<p>"WE"  -- Tarpals pointed to himself and a few of the aliens gathered around him -- "have to FIND" -- he shaded his eyes with one hand and made a show of scanning the room -- "the backup TRANSLATORS" -- he pulsed his hand first at his mouth, then at his right ear -- "so that the purple kitty" -- pointed at navigation officer Garth -- "can tell lemon Jello" -- pointed at Jelqsh -- "how to FLY" --stretched out his arms and did an airborne fighter jet impersonation -- "around the STAR" -- pointed toward the viewport -- "without running out of FUEL" -- flicked the light switch off and tried to make a noise like the engine powering down.</p>
<p>Blank stares. A Trandoshan -- second gunner Binks -- flared his neck and hissed softly. Jelqsh sputtered and copied the last noise Tarpals made, misting him with ... best not to think about it. Murmuring broke out through the crowd, which was worse than useless as the only beings onboard who shared a language were the two green midgets with wispy hair and gigantic elf ears. With universal translators, there was no point in learning to speak another language, even if it was one of the few your vocal cords could actually produce. Without them, everyone else was effectively talking to themselves.</p>
<p>"NO." Adding to the noise was less helpful this time. He physically covered the nearest humanoid's mouth. It licked his hand. "NO." He did this a few more times to others nearby, and eventually the message got across. Soon the only noise was the dull hum of the engines, three decks below.</p>
<p>"Are all the terminals down?" He didn't wait for an answer, and took a few steps to look at the nearest row of screens. Yes. About 1/3 of the crew tried to follow him, and bumped into each other moving back into place when they realized he was only moving 5 steps and coming back. </p>
<p>"Alright. I can't pull up images. No one speaks English. Most of you use number systems that don't look like numbers. Anyone who knows where the backup translators are would have grabbed them without my orders, because despite appearances, you were all competent enough to get hired... somehow. We need to communicate a precise course plotted by mister kitty to blobs McGoo, who then has to fly it by inputting commands without seeing the terminal." Fuck. "Neat." </p>
<p>Tarpals rubbed his hands across his face. "Alright, well, let's try writing at least." He glanced around the bridge for something he could smear on the ground. Nothing came to mind. Fucking sterile aesthetics.</p>
<p>Well, there was only one smearable substance he kept on himself at all times. He walked over to the Trandoshan. The 7' bipedal lizard started to move out of the way, but Tarpals grabbed it by the hand. He pulled the taloned thumb, gripping it the way an infant would hold its father's finger, and abruptly raked it across the inside of his arm. Blood immediately began welling up from the cut.</p>
<p>"Alright, everyone, we're gonna try writing." Tarpals bent down and wrote the numbers 0-9 in blood on the white floor panels. "Does anyone recognize these?"</p>
<p>More blank stares.</p>
<p>Tarpals grabbed at his uniform, ripping off three buttons. "Purple pants, look." He made sure he Garth was looking at him before continuing. He wrote a '1' and placed a single button next to it. He wrote a '2' and placed two buttons. "Something? Anything?"</p>
<p>Navigation officer Garth squinted.</p>
<p>"Here. You try." Tarpals placed the button down next to Garth. "How many?" Tarpals touched the pad of Garth's "finger" to his wound. "Write."</p>
<p>Garth drew a 'c' rotated clockwise by 90 degrees. "Good!" Tarpals placed two buttons down. Garth smiled, drew another few symbols, touching Tarpals' bleeding arm every few strokes.</p>
<p>"Okay, we get it!" Tarpals rolled down his sleeve. Garth enjoyed drawing in blood a bit too much for his taste. "Anyone else? Does anyone recognize this?"</p>
<p>It took a few minutes, but eventually the aliens seemed to understand. The ones who recognized the script clustered around it, and the others stood off to the side. A giant yellow bird disappeared for a few minutes and returned with three portable touchpads. Good. Tarpals was not about to be an inkwell for the knowledge transfer that was about to take place. </p>
<p>Now that most of the crew had caught on, it was easier to go through and see which written number systems they understood. He started with Jelqsh, in case it really was that easy, but Jelqsh's '1' looked more like a diamond. The first time one of the crew drew two sets of symbols for 1 and 2, he hugged it, then immediately regretted his decision as he spent the next 10 minutes trying to wash the burning sensation from his coagulating arm.</p>
<p>After all the writing samples had been saved, he kept all the samples with two sets of writing, as well as Jelqsh's and Garth's.</p>
<p>"Fuck. yes." It took both xenobiologist Lavers and engineer Anglom, translating into a third set of characters Tarpals dubbed "No opposable thumbs script", but they could successfully translate from kitty scratch to blob speak. This round of charades was less difficult. Once Garth realized who was at the end of the chain, it knew the only relevant information was the flight path, and immediately began writing the math out. "Spotted dolphin" Lavers looked on and occasionally chittered quietly to itself, while "Udders-R-Us" Anglom waited in the wings. </p>
<p>Tarpals promised whatever god was watching over him that if he got out of this, he would definitely start mentally referring to his crew by their name and not by racial slurs.</p>
