Rune Wars (4-turn cycle, 8 card action hand) meets Terra Mystica (hexes with terraforming) meets Scythe (upgrades, light engine building). Flavor You are AIs owned by rival surveying corporations collecting geospatial data on an inhospitable exoplanet. You'll need to adapt to the terrain, harvest resources, create more factories and mechs, and deploy scanners to retrieve the most complete picture of the planet to sell to colonists or mining companies. Goal You win by scoring the most points. The only thing worth points is the number of unique hexes scanned. Scan the highest number of hexes before the game ends . Setup You start with one factory , two hexes, two mechs , all with stands of your starting color. You start with 8 alloy . Board Hexes Hexes are one of 7 colors: red, blue, yellow, purple, green, orange, and black. Some hexes are \"special\" hexes, marked with ??? (some icon). A mech can only occupy hexes that are within 1 color of its stand . Within 1 color means exactly matching, or adjacent on the color wheel . Special hexes require an exact color match, but produce an extra alloy when quarried . No color is adjacent to black on the color wheel . This means black hexes cannot be friendly and must be terraformed . Color Wheel Factions 2-3p: played factions must be all primary colors (RBY) or all secondary colors (PGO). 4p: the unplayed factions must be directly opposite each other 5p: single unplayed faction gets neutral units that defend territories - TBD 6p: all factions in play Faction Abilities TBD - expansion lol Pieces You have scanners , mechs , factories in your color. There are stands of every color. Everyone can gather alloy . There are, in some vague sense, objective tokens . There are no piece limits. Scanners Placed with the scan action to scan 1 or more hexes. Scanners are not units, do not go on hexes, and cannot be destroyed. Placed without stand (really, just place any stand under them, because they'll fall over without it). Cannot be moved or destroyed. Alloy The only resource. Quarried from hexes you control. Goes into your personal supply; does not touch the board. Units Mechs and factories are units and go on hexes. Any unit controls a hex. Each unit has a stand denoting modifications. Stands Stands are just bases for pieces, and do nothing on their own. Mech stands show the modifications the mech has undergone, and thus, where the mech can move. Factory stands show the modified mechs a factory can produce. Mechs Mechs control hexes , build and expand factories , can move , and can engage in combat . See other sections for details and exceptions, but in general, mechs have 1 attack, 1 defense, 2 movement, and can only move onto or through hexes within 1 color of their stand on the color wheel . Factories Can be expanded for extra mech spawning and defense . Factory stands are always the color of the hex they occupy - if the hex is terraformed , immediately change the factory stand to match. Factories produce mechs with matching stands. Factories can only manufacture at most a number of mechs equal to the number of expansions. Factories add extra defense to a hex - each story counts for one combat strength. A new factory will spawn with 2 stories, and factories can expand to up to 4 stories. Factories on hexes successfully invaded by an opponent will become damaged and owned by that opponent, losing all but 1 story. Turns Simultaneous declaration: each player selects a card to play by placing it face down in front of themselves, and when everyone has selected a card , everyone flips their card up at the same time. Cards are mostly simultaneous action (with the exception of combat ) , but if someone requests, other cards can be ordered as well . Days Days are 3 rounds - morning, evening, and night. Cards played each turn are kept face-up on the table in front of the player and cannot be reused until the following day. Morning Pick up all cards played yesterday. Evening You have +1 upgrade for cards played in the evening. There is no benefit to +1 upgrade on maxed out cards. Night ??? Cards Think Rune Wars, but no supremacy bonuses, only upgrades. Cards can be upgraded for better effect. Cards start with zero upgrades. On cards with multiple actions ( Develop and Streamline ) you may take any number of the actions in order . Cards are technically resolved in numbered order, though outside of combat , most cards can be resolved simultaneously. Ties are resolved by completed objectives , then unused alloy, then bidding alloy (say a number, next person must bid higher or lose the tie). Tie winner chooses who goes first. Develop - TBD Priority 1. With mech: expand any number of existing factories once each with 3 alloy; With mech: spend 8 alloy to create one factory one expansion; With mech: terraform up to 3 controlled or adjacent territories to be one color more or less using 6 alloy (enemy territories can only be cleaned). Upgrades: Constraint optimization : Factories cost 2 less. Factory expansions cost 1 less. Terraforming costs 2 less. Coordinate Priority 2. Choose 2 hexes. Move mechs from those hexes to 2 adjacent friendly or empty destination hexes. Each mech cannot move more than 1 hex this way. Upgrades: Multithreading : No limit on number of hexes. Each mech may move to an adjacent friendly or empty hex. Overclocking : Mechs may move at speed 2 if the hex they move through is friendly . Explore Priority 3. Move any number of mechs from any number of hexes to a destination hex. Can only move through friendly or empty territories, and still have to match colors. Upgrades: Quantum tunneling : Treat identical colors separated by 1 hex as adjacent instead. (This can result in an effective speed of 4.) Overvolting : Gain two extra combat strength this turn. Multiprocessing : Choose a second destination hex. Quarry Priority 4. Gain 2 alloy from each friendly hex. Upgrades: Breadth-first search : Normal hexes produce 3 alloy instead of 2. Depth-first search : Special hexes produce 5 alloy instead of 2. Manufacture Priority 5. With any number of factories : spend 5 alloy per mech to deploy mechs . Each factory can manufacture at most a number of mechs equal to its number of stories. The mech 's stand color matches the factory stand color. Mechs of your faction color are 1 cheaper. Upgrades: Garbage collecting : Existing mechs (up to the number of factory stories) on a factory hex can be recycled for 3 alloy each. Reclaiming does not count against the manufacturing limit. Resource Scheduling : Mechs cost 3 instead of 5. Streamline Priority 6. Can only be played at morning. Any number of times and hexes: combine mechs on the same hex to merge stand colors; Complete one new quest (must currently meet requirements) and upgrade a card X times based on # Upgrades ; 0: once 1: once 2: twice Upgrade cap: 2 Scan Priority 7. With mech: Create a scanner on the intersection between 3 friendly hexes . Scanners can also be placed on the edge of the planet if you really want (the missing hex counts as friendly ). Scanners do not need a stand: they cannot be moved or destroyed once placed, regardless of terraform actions, hex control, or combat. Scanners can be co-located. Scanners cost 8 alloy . Upgrades: Horizontal scaling : You may place two scanners at two different intersections by paying alloy for each. Privilege escalation : Only 2 of the adjacent hexes must be friendly . Colo : Scanners placed at an intersection where scanner(s) already exist cost 2 instead of 8. Movement Mechs are the only pieces that can be moved. Mechs using Explore have a speed of 2, meaning they can move from one hex, through another hex, to a final hex. By default, mechs using Coordinate have a speed of 1, meaning they can only move to an adjacent hex, though this can be upgraded to speed 2. Mechs Upgrading the Explore action allow you to move mechs at speed 2. Mechs can only move through friendly or empty hexes that they can stand in. Upgrading the Explore action again allows you to blink between hexes of the same color that are less than 2 hexes apart. Tunneling between these hexes counts allows you to to bypass enemy or inhospitable hexes. Tunneling between these hexes treats them as adjacent, meaning you could move up to 4 hexes away. Combat Interstellar law prohibits sabotaging competing efforts, but short of destroying a company's scanners, no one will be able to prove anything. This means your mechs aren't designed for combat, but neither are anyone else's. Your best plan is mutually assured destruction: overload your power source and explode your units to take out theirs. Factories will enter lockdown during combat - you'll have to spend some explosive strength to damage them enough to get in and take control. Combat is just 1:1 - attacker sacrifices X units to destroy X defender units. Each factory expansion counts as a unit (each mech counts as one unit regardless of modifications). If you successfully invade a hex with a factory, destroy your opponent's factory and place an unexpanded factory (white stand) on the hex. You can choose to attack with fewer units if you want to weaken your opponent's forces, though you won't gain control of the hex. A tie means the territory becomes empty - any factories are completely destroyed. Objectives Your technology wasn't designed with this particular planet's environment in mind. Gather more training data to make actions more efficient. Completing objectives can only be done via the Streamline action, which will let you immediately upgrade a card . See the list below. Upgrades Every action is ultimately software. Deploying patches after release is standard procedure. Upgrades are per card . Upgrading involves grabbing the higher number card of that name adding a tally to your card and placing an objective token of your color on that objective to mark it off. You may upgrade any card, regardless of whether it has been played today. Upgrading the currently played card does not change your current action. There are a total of 27 possible upgrades, but only 17 objectives. When objective tokens run out, game ends that night . Objective List Centrist : Control the center hex Tourist : Control a hex 7 away from your starting hexes Rogue : Control a hex in an enemy's home row Technologist : Fully expand a factory Specialist : Fully upgrade a card Settler : Control 15 hexes (4p, 2p: 30, 3p: 20, 5-6p: 10) Linear : Control a straight line of 5 hexes (4p, 2p: 7, 3p: 5, 5-6p: 4) Inhospitable : Control a black hex Entrenched : Control 4 home row hexes (secondary-advantaged) Innovative : Unlock a secondary that includes a color you didn't start with (primary-advantaged) Flexible : Unlock all secondaries (secondary-advantaged) Strategist : Terraform 3 times Capitalist : Control 4 factories Ruthless : Successfully invade Generalist : Upgrade a card, place a scanner, and expand a factory Surveyor : Place 3 corner scanners Hoarder : Have 15 unspent alloy Game Over Game ends on the night of the day that we run out of objective markers? Or someone completes 10 objectives? How much? No idea - 2-3: 8/p, 4: 7/p, 5-6: 6/p ^ These are probably too long. Scoring Surveying is zero-sum - miners and colonizers will buy from whomever has the most complete data set. The winner is the faction with the most hex data uploaded back to the Core Worlds. Each unique hex covered by a scanner is worth 1 point. Ties are broken by number of upgrades. Glossary Empty : A hex without units . Enemy : A hex with a unit not matching your faction. Friendly : A hex with a unit matching your faction. Home row : The set of 4 outer edge hexes for each faction, including unplayed factions and your own faction. Story : Each story on a factory counts as one combat strength and increases the maximum number of mechs that factory can Manufacture . Unit : A mech or factory . Questions Should you have a limited number of scanners and upgrading give you more scanners? Should anything to do with your color be easier? Unit discount, extra harvest, farther teleport? Is there a cooler word for \"upgrades\"? I want it to be most software themed, like builds / releases / patches, but those don't really start from zero like upgrades do. What should make each faction different? Colors aren't white primary secondary black, it's exact and off-by-one, where you can expand into similar territories (terra mystica style) Boooo Upkeep mechs - 1 plus one per mod then hexes have to produce more per color, and hexes have to produce like 3 base so each hex still nets 3? but then having 2 black units on a black hex net 0, that's terrible. upkeep mechs: 0 plus 1 per mod? hexes produce 4 base Does upkeep do anything? You just have to scale production so that upkeep matches. Maybe you don't need a limit or upkeep, since people are incentivized to spread out anyway. Mechs are fundamentally workers, not fighters, so they kinda need to be the thing producing resources. night mech limit by controlled hexes - 3 * #hexes? probs not since you're not even strongly incentivized to own hexes after deploying scanners can people place scanners in the same corners? Yes Good and Bad I like the 4 turn round setup. I like the color requirements to expand, and the generalization penalty of more expensive units since they don't attack better. I like terraforming to make defending / expanding easier. I like teleporting / tunneling color to color to skip over terraformed defenses and reach the center. I like the flavor concept of mechs plus mods to enter hexes hostile in different ways. I like the base concept of combat and area control. I like deterministic combat and MAD. I like that permanent area control isn't the goal. I dislike 8 different actions and having to explain how to pick them up - complexity penalty. I dislike that more hostile hexes aren't more rewarding somehow. I dislike that your faction color doesn't matter somehow. I dislike that combat doesn't favor defenders. Alternate ideas You are organisms, and you have to adapt to terrain that's +/- one color off? You are claiming territory splatoon style? 61-hex map instead of 100? (hexagon of sides of 6 hexagons) Base principles I want a color-based area control game engine-building game where area control isn't the win condition. I like the trophy placement win condition. I like the four turn days / years with different effects. I don't know how to structure actions to be balanced. I don't know how to make an engine builder. I need to decide what the \"engine\" component is. What drives the game? I want it to be the board, not a deck to build or something. so how can you build an engine with only one material type you gather from the board and objectives you complete? I don't want to have multiple material types - that's too much like scythe or rune wars. Demoing Drop into partially completed game - each player has different upgrades, starting alloys, setup, etc. one factory on the first in forced asymmetry with groups of 6 hexes to start with 3 players take out the outer ring scan upgrade could be \"scan twice\" streamline should be automatic every morning not completing an objective every turn felt like losing make certain cards more incentivized by bonus points (upgrading certain cards gives bonus points) 17 objectives is hard to track Scythe goals match an action very clearly and you need to do it all of the times, but this has a variable number for each objective top-bottom it would be nice to make the core 3 (scan streamline quarry) not played every time","title":"ExoGIS"},{"location":"game/#exogis","text":"Exoplanet Geographical Information System Area control with objectives and light engine building.

Factories will enter lockdown during combat - you'll have to spend some explosive strength to damage them enough to get in and take control. Combat is just 1:1 - attacker sacrifices X units to destroy X defender units. Each factory expansion counts as a unit (each mech counts as one unit regardless of modifications). If you successfully invade a hex with a factory, destroy your opponent's factory and place an unexpanded factory (white stand) on the hex.

(Too many LitRPG novels treat the main character as the first intelligent person to ever exist somewhere, and it's baffling how dumb they think the \"average person\" is.) Date: 20200829 Tags: Sci-fi, Fantasy I open my eyes at the sound of a busy morning and find myself in a doorway, facing the interior of a restaurant housed in what looks like a large cabin. Wait, what? \"Sir, could you please move out of the way? You're blocking our patrons from the store.\" A tall, bald man, dressed in a long white shirt and dull brown pants, stares down at me with a look of resigned patience. \"I don't understand,\" I say, allowing myself to be led away from the entrance. \"I don't -- How did I get here? ... Where is 'here'?\" I look around as I speak, taking in a building that reminds me of a tourist trap in a mountain town -- treated logs forming the outline, and some sort of sealant stuck between them to prevent any airflow through the gaps. All the furniture, including a counter, shelves, tables, and chairs appear to be made of the same wood, and illumination comes only from the overcast sky through the the open-air windows, though I see some hanging lanterns at strategic intervals. \"Ah.\" The man's eyes seem to brighten. \"A new Traveler, I wonder?\" \"... I'm sorry? I don't understand. Look, I must have been ... sleepwalking.\" Unlikely, but nothing sounds more plausible. \"Do you have a phone I can use to call an Uber or something? I'll be out of your h-- hands in no time.\" Not a great save. Luckily, the man's smile widens in response. \"Yes, a Traveler indeed! Come, come! You must be famished. Let's get you something to eat while I explain.\" He gestures emphatically toward a table and tells me to wait for some food while he goes and grabs a few notes. When I ask, he just calls them notes on travelers and hurries off. This has to be some prank. Nothing stands out about the night before, and there's no reason I can think of for waking up in what looks like the doorway of an Amish diner. I sit and take stock. I'm definitely not dreaming. I feel fine: no headache, no bumps; nothing feels scraped, broken, or bruised, but I am a bit itchy. I realize I'm dressed similarly to everyone else: thick, dull-colored pants and a long-sleeved, billowing, off-white shirt tied at my waist with a bit of twine. From the itching, I assume wool, though it might just be due to hygenie of the mystery clothing source. My pockets are empty, and I don't see a phone anywhere. At the counter, a woman is trading large coins for cheese, fresh bread, and hot meat. Everyone walking into the diner greets each person they pass by name, usually accompanied by a nod or a slap on the back. I get a few curious stares, but my expression must turn them away, though it doesn't prevent smiles and a few polite waves. Everyone seems too friendly. I can't decide whether my working theory should be a cult abduction or the weirdest melatonin-induced cross-country sleepwalking session I've ever heard of. I'm not-so-surreptiously checking myself for needle marks when my host returns with a plate of food in each hand, some looseleaf paper dangling from his grip on the underside of one of the plates. \"There! I'm told you know of 'sandwiches' in your territory?\" He doesn't wait for an answer as he begins to cut his bread into slices and gestures for me to do the same. I look at my plate and see a sourdough loaf, white cheese, and sausage. I follow his lead, not seeing any reason to distrust the food. If this is a cult, they've clearly already drugged me, so I can't do much worse. I give him an expectant look, which he studiously ignores as he takes a large bite. I finish first. [WP] You are on board a federation starship. The universal translators have just gone down during a life-or-death situation. Most of the crew can't communicate with each other without them. \"God fucking dammit.\" Captain Tarpals swore, but his inflection never wavered from calm and professional. \"The only silver lining is that I can finally call you a worthless slimeball pilot as long as I smile while doing it. Isn't that right, you greasy hunk of snot?\" \"OOOgz ba'sjks,\" officer Jelqsh burbled happily. Well, Tarpals assumed it was happily. A gaping hole for a mouth and blinking eye stalks didn't tell him a whole lot. \"Alright, everybody! Listen up!\" Heads perked up from behind various terminals. At least yelling still worked. Tarpals gestured for everyone to come closer. The races with arms started forward. Tarpals grabbed the nearest non-humanoid, a pulsing, fuzzy ball, and pulled it toward the group. That seemed to get the message across to the rest of them, and they all gathered at the back of the bridge. \"WE\" -- Tarpals pointed to himself and a few of the aliens gathered around him -- \"have to FIND\" -- he shaded his eyes with one hand and made a show of scanning the room -- \"the backup TRANSLATORS\" -- he pulsed his hand first at his mouth, then at his right ear -- \"so that the purple kitty\" -- pointed at navigation officer Garth -- \"can tell lemon Jello\" -- pointed at Jelqsh -- \"how to FLY\" --stretched out his arms and did an airborne fighter jet impersonation -- \"around the STAR\" -- pointed toward the viewport -- \"without running out of FUEL\" -- flicked the light switch off and tried to make a noise like the engine powering down. Blank stares. A Trandoshan -- second gunner Binks -- flared his neck and hissed softly. Jelqsh sputtered and copied the last noise Tarpals made, misting him with ... best not to think about it. Murmuring broke out through the crowd, which was worse than useless as the only beings onboard who shared a language were the two green midgets with wispy hair and gigantic elf ears. With universal translators, there was no point in learning to speak another language, even if it was one of the few your vocal cords could actually produce. Without them, everyone else was effectively talking to themselves. \"NO.\" Adding to the noise was less helpful this time. He physically covered the nearest humanoid's mouth. It licked his hand. \"NO.\" He did this a few more times to others nearby, and eventually the message got across. Soon the only noise was the dull hum of the engines, three decks below. \"Are all the terminals down?\" He didn't wait for an answer, and took a few steps to look at the nearest row of screens. Yes. About 1/3 of the crew tried to follow him, and bumped into each other moving back into place when they realized he was only moving 5 steps and coming back. \"Alright. I can't pull up images. No one speaks English. Most of you use number systems that don't look like numbers. Anyone who knows where the backup translators are would have grabbed them without my orders, because despite appearances, you were all competent enough to get hired... somehow. We need to communicate a precise course plotted by mister kitty to blobs McGoo, who then has to fly it by inputting commands without seeing the terminal.\" Fuck. \"Neat.\" Tarpals rubbed his hands across his face. \"Alright, well, let's try writing at least.\" He glanced around the bridge for something he could smear on the ground. Nothing came to mind. Fucking sterile aesthetics. Well, there was only one smearable substance he kept on himself at all times. He walked over to the Trandoshan. The 7' bipedal lizard started to move out of the way, but Tarpals grabbed it by the hand. He pulled the taloned thumb, gripping it the way an infant would hold its father's finger, and abruptly raked it across the inside of his arm. Blood immediately began welling up from the cut. \"Alright, everyone, we're gonna try writing.\" Tarpals bent down and wrote the numbers 0-9 in blood on the white floor panels. \"Does anyone recognize these?\" More blank stares. Tarpals grabbed at his uniform, ripping off three buttons. \"Purple pants, look.\" He made sure he Garth was looking at him before continuing. He wrote a '1' and placed a single button next to it. He wrote a '2' and placed two buttons. \"Something? Anything?\" Navigation officer Garth squinted. \"Here. You try.\" Tarpals placed the button down next to Garth. \"How many?\" Tarpals touched the pad of Garth's \"finger\" to his wound. \"Write.\" Garth drew a 'c' rotated clockwise by 90 degrees. \"Good!\" Tarpals placed two buttons down. Garth smiled, drew another few symbols, touching Tarpals' bleeding arm every few strokes. \"Okay, we get it!\" Tarpals rolled down his sleeve. Garth enjoyed drawing in blood a bit too much for his taste. \"Anyone else? Does anyone recognize this?\" It took a few minutes, but eventually the aliens seemed to understand. The ones who recognized the script clustered around it, and the others stood off to the side. A giant yellow bird disappeared for a few minutes and returned with three portable touchpads. Good. Tarpals was not about to be an inkwell for the knowledge transfer that was about to take place.

Date: 20200829 Tags: Sci-fi, Fantasy I open my eyes at the sound of a busy morning and find myself in a doorway, facing the interior of a restaurant housed in what looks like a large cabin. Wait, what? \"Sir, could you please move out of the way? You're blocking our patrons from the store.\" A tall, bald man, dressed in a long white shirt and dull brown pants, stares down at me with a look of resigned patience. \"I don't understand,\" I say, allowing myself to be led away from the entrance. \"I don't -- How did I get here? ... Where is 'here'?\" I look around as I speak, taking in a building that reminds me of a tourist trap in a mountain town -- treated logs forming the outline, and some sort of sealant stuck between them to prevent any airflow through the gaps. All the furniture, including a counter, shelves, tables, and chairs appear to be made of the same wood, and illumination comes only from the overcast sky through the the open-air windows, though I see some hanging lanterns at strategic intervals. \"Ah.\" The man's eyes seem to brighten. \"A new Traveler, I wonder?\" \"... I'm sorry? I don't understand. Look, I must have been ... sleepwalking.\" Unlikely, but nothing sounds more plausible. \"Do you have a phone I can use to call an Uber or something? I'll be out of your h-- hands in no time.\" Not a great save. Luckily, the man's smile widens in response. \"Yes, a Traveler indeed! Come, come! You must be famished. Let's get you something to eat while I explain.\" He gestures emphatically toward a table and tells me to wait for some food while he goes and grabs a few notes. When I ask, he just calls them notes on travelers and hurries off. This has to be some prank. Nothing stands out about the night before, and there's no reason I can think of for waking up in what looks like the doorway of an Amish diner. I sit and take stock. I'm definitely not dreaming. I feel fine: no headache, no bumps; nothing feels scraped, broken, or bruised, but I am a bit itchy. I realize I'm dressed similarly to everyone else: thick, dull-colored pants and a long-sleeved, billowing, off-white shirt tied at my waist with a bit of twine. From the itching, I assume wool, though it might just be due to hygenie of the mystery clothing source. My pockets are empty, and I don't see a phone anywhere. At the counter, a woman is trading large coins for cheese, fresh bread, and hot meat. Everyone walking into the diner greets each person they pass by name, usually accompanied by a nod or a slap on the back. I get a few curious stares, but my expression must turn them away, though it doesn't prevent smiles and a few polite waves. Everyone seems too friendly. I can't decide whether my working theory should be a cult abduction or the weirdest melatonin-induced cross-country sleepwalking session I've ever heard of. I'm not-so-surreptiously checking myself for needle marks when my host returns with a plate of food in each hand, some looseleaf paper dangling from his grip on the underside of one of the plates. \"There! I'm told you know of 'sandwiches' in your territory?\" He doesn't wait for an answer as he begins to cut his bread into slices and gestures for me to do the same. I look at my plate and see a sourdough loaf, white cheese, and sausage. I follow his lead, not seeing any reason to distrust the food. If this is a cult, they've clearly already drugged me, so I can't do much worse. I give him an expectant look, which he studiously ignores as he takes a large bite. I finish first.","title":"You are transported into a LitRPG (Multiplayer Role-Playing Game Universe), but it's already been optimized."},{"location":"writing/#wp-you-are-on-board-a-federation-starship-the-universal-translators-have-just-gone-down-during-a-life-or-death-situation-most-of-the-crew-cant-communicate-with-each-other-without-them","text":"\"God fucking dammit.\" Captain Tarpals swore, but his inflection never wavered from calm and professional. \"The only silver lining is that I can finally call you a worthless slimeball pilot as long as I smile while doing it. Isn't that right, you greasy hunk of snot?\" \"OOOgz ba'sjks,\" officer Jelqsh burbled happily. Well, Tarpals assumed it was happily. A gaping hole for a mouth and blinking eye stalks didn't tell him a whole lot. \"Alright, everybody! Listen up!\" Heads perked up from behind various terminals. At least yelling still worked. Tarpals gestured for everyone to come closer. The races with arms started forward. Tarpals grabbed the nearest non-humanoid, a pulsing, fuzzy ball, and pulled it toward the group. That seemed to get the message across to the rest of them, and they all gathered at the back of the bridge. \"WE\" -- Tarpals pointed to himself and a few of the aliens gathered around him -- \"have to FIND\" -- he shaded his eyes with one hand and made a show of scanning the room -- \"the backup TRANSLATORS\" -- he pulsed his hand first at his mouth, then at his right ear -- \"so that the purple kitty\" -- pointed at navigation officer Garth -- \"can tell lemon Jello\" -- pointed at Jelqsh -- \"how to FLY\" --stretched out his arms and did an airborne fighter jet impersonation -- \"around the STAR\" -- pointed toward the viewport -- \"without running out of FUEL\" -- flicked the light switch off and tried to make a noise like the engine powering down. Blank stares. A Trandoshan -- second gunner Binks -- flared his neck and hissed softly. Jelqsh sputtered and copied the last noise Tarpals made, misting him with ... best not to think about it. Murmuring broke out through the crowd, which was worse than useless as the only beings onboard who shared a language were the two green midgets with wispy hair and gigantic elf ears. With universal translators, there was no point in learning to speak another language, even if it was one of the few your vocal cords could actually produce. Without them, everyone else was effectively talking to themselves. \"NO.\" Adding to the noise was less helpful this time. He physically covered the nearest humanoid's mouth. It licked his hand. \"NO.\" He did this a few more times to others nearby, and eventually the message got across. Soon the only noise was the dull hum of the engines, three decks below. \"Are all the terminals down?\" He didn't wait for an answer, and took a few steps to look at the nearest row of screens. Yes. About 1/3 of the crew tried to follow him, and bumped into each other moving back into place when they realized he was only moving 5 steps and coming back. \"Alright. I can't pull up images. No one speaks English. Most of you use number systems that don't look like numbers. Anyone who knows where the backup translators are would have grabbed them without my orders, because despite appearances, you were all competent enough to get hired... somehow. We need to communicate a precise course plotted by mister kitty to blobs McGoo, who then has to fly it by inputting commands without seeing the terminal.\" Fuck. \"Neat.\" Tarpals rubbed his hands across his face. \"Alright, well, let's try writing at least.\" He glanced around the bridge for something he could smear on the ground. Nothing came to mind. Fucking sterile aesthetics. Well, there was only one smearable substance he kept on himself at all times. He walked over to the Trandoshan. The 7' bipedal lizard started to move out of the way, but Tarpals grabbed it by the hand. He pulled the taloned thumb, gripping it the way an infant would hold its father's finger, and abruptly raked it across the inside of his arm. Blood immediately began welling up from the cut. \"Alright, everyone, we're gonna try writing.\" Tarpals bent down and wrote the numbers 0-9 in blood on the white floor panels. \"Does anyone recognize these?\" More blank stares. Tarpals grabbed at his uniform, ripping off three buttons. \"Purple pants, look.\" He made sure he Garth was looking at him before continuing. He wrote a '1' and placed a single button next to it. He wrote a '2' and placed two buttons. \"Something? Anything?\" Navigation officer Garth squinted. \"Here. You try.\" Tarpals placed the button down next to Garth. \"How many?\" Tarpals touched the pad of Garth's \"finger\" to his wound. \"Write.\" Garth drew a 'c' rotated clockwise by 90 degrees. \"Good!\" Tarpals placed two buttons down. Garth smiled, drew another few symbols, touching Tarpals' bleeding arm every few strokes. \"Okay, we get it!\" Tarpals rolled down his sleeve. Garth enjoyed drawing in blood a bit too much for his taste. \"Anyone else? Does anyone recognize this?\" It took a few minutes, but eventually the aliens seemed to understand. The ones who recognized the script clustered around it, and the others stood off to the side. A giant yellow bird disappeared for a few minutes and returned with three portable touchpads. Good. Tarpals was not about to be an inkwell for the knowledge transfer that was about to take place.
